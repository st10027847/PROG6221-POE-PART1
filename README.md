# POEPART1

When opening the project and source code, make sure to include all of the files necessary for the proper and correct execution of the program. You will need to open the source code within MicroSoft Visual Studio (Code Editor/IDE used for this project) and build the project.

Once you have built the project and all seems to be fine, make sure to press the run/start button to compile the project. At this point, the project should run, and a console screen will pop up. This is where you will be inputting all of your information. Follow the options provided by the menu and enter your respective information. The menu will run again after all of your information has been entered and will give you options to either view/display your recipe, or to adjust the quantity and values of the ingredients, depending on whether you want to add a recipe or clear all of the data and start from scratch.

When displaying the data, you will find that the steps will be underneath the list of ingredients and that it will be numbered. Once you have completed your recipe and displaayed it, you can exit the program by closing the console using the exit key (The cross in the top right corner) and then the program will close and will end/terminate.
